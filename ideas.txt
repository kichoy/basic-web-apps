Ideas

(In no particular order)

- Add a new field to a message,
  e.g., "current mood", "location",
  anything really

- Swearword filter

- Detect URLs and turn them into
  clickable links
  
- Prevent text so that it doesn't "run on"

X Escape messages that contain HTML
  and other invalid/special text (xmp tag simple fix for forcing literal txt display)

- Allow users to create a message
  with a custom background color

X Allow users to choose a "message 
  style", e.g., bold, italics, etc.

X Allow users to delete a message

- All users to edit an existing message

- Keep track of when message was
  last edited and display that info
  to other users (e.g., created_at
  vs. edited_at).

- Allow users to like a message

- Allow users to sort homepage by # of 
  likes
